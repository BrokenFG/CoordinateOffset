Contributing
============

Pull requests are welcome! Try to maintain the existing code style, but I don't have much else in the way of guidelines.
Please reach out on Discord to @jtchips if you'd like to discuss changes you want to make.

I'm trying to document as much as I can in the `docs` folder.

Updates
-------
I hope to make this plugin as easy as possible to update to future Minecraft versions in case I no longer want to
maintain it. Please see [Updating.md](docs/Updating.md) where I have outlined what I roughly expect to be the standard
updating process.
